# Sound Scattering from Spheres using Multipole Reexpansion

This directory implements [1], which develops a computational technique for the solution of problems of wave scattering from multiple spheres. It constructs the theory for the translation and reexpansion of multipole solutions of the Helmholtz equation for fast and exact recursive computation of the matrix elements.

To understand how the recursive translation and sectorial coefficients are calculated, please refer to the extensive technical report [2] which develops exact expressions for translations and rotations of local and multipole fundamental solutions of the Helmholtz equation in spherical coordinates.
